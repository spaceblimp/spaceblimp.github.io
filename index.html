<p>SpaceBlimp 7 is a community project driven by independent specialists from DC, Maryland, and members from HacDC, Rockville Makerspace, and Unallocated Hackerspace. The team is dedicated to experimenting with new technologies that will make near space activities less expensive and more broadly accessible. From electronics to mechanical design to physics, the interconnectedness of disciplines teaches a lesson in engineering teamwork and collaboration.</p>
<p>Local area hackers, space enthusiasts, and community members have come together to share and learn new skills in the design, construction, and launch of the project.</p>
