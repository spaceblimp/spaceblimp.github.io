</section>
“Spaceblimp” is an educational and exploratory high-altitude stratospheric balloon project that lofts various payloads to near-space (about 100,000ft, see photo above from the sixth launch). Whether you just want to join us, see what the project is about and help out, or already have a payload idea you'd like to develop and launch, or are an educator looking to bring cool projects to area schools, come join us!

At this worknight meeting we'll be working in al the critical parts and tools are on-hand, on various payloads, coordination with the FAA, the testing of the GPS and radios. Our testing launch will be in March 3rd and the official launch will be in April.

***  Important to know
Spaceblimp 7 looks to add new components that weren’t part of HacDC’s previous six Spaceblimp launches. By forming a partnership with several other area makerspaces, volunteers, hackers and educators we are expanding our team, pooling resources and aim to increase the project's visibility to the benefit of all involved. This will also expose high school students to educational and technical resources outside of the school environment as well as giving all the participants the opportunity to share skills and interests to work together and learn from one another to achieve shared goals. Local area hackers and space enthusiasts will come share and learn new skills in the design, construction and launch of the payloads.
