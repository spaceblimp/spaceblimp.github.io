title: About Us - SpaceBlimp 7 (HackerSLS)
---
<section class="about-page page-content">
    <p>The Spaceblimp 7 (SB7) is an educational and exploratory stratospheric  balloon made of latex, filled with helium or hydrogen and expands as it ascend (about 100,000ft) through Earth's atmosphere. This balloon is cabable of carritying various eqiptment called payloads, these payloads can include electronics eqiptment, radio transmitters, cameras, GPS receivers and atmospheric or space experiments to nearspace. The project has Technical, logistical and Educational goals which are describe below. 
        
       MORE ABOUT OUR PROJECT:
        Spaceblimp 7 is collaborative community project  of area makerspaces such as between HacDC hackerspace, Rockville RSC Makerspace and Unallocated Space, independent spaecialists, volunteers, hackers, students and educators. The Spaceblimp 7 team is committed to provide a proejct that is inclusive where all the participants can share theor various skills technical and non technical to work together and learn from one another to achieve shared goals.
    
    <p>The baseline technical goals are the safe and successful launch, tracking and recovery of a stratospheric balloon and its payloads. These goals involve exploration of concepts of buoyancy, basic electronics and energy storage, triangulation and timekeeping, radio propagation, weather prediction, FAA regulations and stratospheric environment conditions. In addition to these baseline goals, the project will welcome additional technical goals from volunteers and students primarily in the form of payload experiments suggested, designed and built by them. Spaceblimp will encourage use of CubeSat geometry payloads to give students experience with the CubeSat design constraints and to foster discussion with future other CubeSat missions.</p>
    
    <p>The educational objective is primarily to provide an engaging, multi-day hands-on educational experience for students and volunteers heavily focused on STEM. Students will be engaged in a hands-on lesson by disassembling, reassembling and testing the basic tracking module components (GPS, radios) and other payloads. The nature of the balloon flight will naturally lead to discussion of scientific subjects like buoyancy, atmospheric composition and density, radio propagation, weather prediction and technical topics like power consumption and energy storage. Students will have first-hand exposure to a team working environment with delegation of responsibilities and the necessary communication and coordination. Critically, students will be allowed to suggest, design and build their own balloon payloads to be launched into near-space. This kind of self-directed educational approach uses students own natural curiosity and motivation to increase engagement and their sense of ownership of the resulting project.</p>

This Spaceblimp 7 looks to add new components that weren’t part of HacDC’s previous six Spaceblimp launches. By forming a partnership with several other area makerspaces, volunteers, hackers and educators we are expanding our team and pooling resources. By expanding the project we aim to increase its visibility and benefit all the organizations involved as well as and increase fund-raising opportunities to help sustain all the partners/organizations and the project Spaceblimp in the long-term.
